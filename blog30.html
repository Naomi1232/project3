            We picked up the secret to the irresistible strawberry muffins from our favorite chef,Roberta, in Bologna, Italy.Using her treasured, handwritten recipe, we quickly mixed and backed a batch of these sweet, sugar - dusted treats.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we hovered by the oven door, mesmerized by the baking magic,Roberta caught us in the act.When I reached for the door handle,she playfully swatted my hand away, cautioning,
            "Don't dare open the oven door while desserts are baking! You'll let the magic escape, and they'll fall flat." Wise words from a seasoned baker!" 
          </p>
